1. AutoH3Tool must be in the H3EK folder
2. selected file/folder must be within H3EK\data (or tags) folder depending on the command
3. exported tags must be within \tags\.. imported data must be in \data\..

note: AutoH3Tool uses for full directory addresses do not edit them or it will not work
	example: [C:\programs\Steam\steamapps\common\]H3EK\data\objects
	portion within [] brackets will automatically be removed "unlike Tool.exe"

AutoH3Tool is a automation script for (H3T) Tool.exe 
so you have to type less! after selecting a command drag and drop your file or folder into the CMD window and press enter!
